Given an array ``nums``. We define a running sum of an array as ``runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i])``.

Return the running sum of ``nums``.

#### Example 1:
``Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]``<br/>
``Output: [1,3,6,10]``<br/>
``Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].``<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

You're given strings ``jewels`` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and ``stones`` representing the stones you have. Each character in ``stones`` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so ``"a"`` is considered a different type of stone from ``"A"``.

#### Example 1:
``Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"``<br/>
``Output: 3``<br/>
